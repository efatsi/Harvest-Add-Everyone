##Harvest-Add-Everyone

###What it Does
Adding people to Harvst projects is a pain, this is a Chrome extension which adds a bunch of buttons to the interface for adding different batches of people to a Harvest Project.

###How to Install

If you have Git and your Github credentials set up on your computer, you can follow the instructions below. If you don't think you've done those things, just download and unzip the project from [here](https://github.com/efatsi/Harvest-Add-Everyone/blob/master/Harvest-Add-Everyone.zip?raw=true), and follow instructions 3 through 6.

1. Open up a new Terminal window
2. Type the following commands:
  - `cd ~/Desktop`
  - `git clone git@github.com:efatsi/Harvest-Add-Everyone.git`
    - This copies the project from Github on to your Desktop into a directory called `Harvest-Add-Everyone`. Feel free to move it wherever you want at this point
3. Visit `chrome://extensions` (in Chrome of course)
4. Check the box next to **Developer Mode**
5. Click **Load unpacked extension...**
6. Find the `Harvest-Add-Everyone` directory you recently acquired and select it

You can then try to create or edit a Harvest project and see options to add Everyone or different Labs.
