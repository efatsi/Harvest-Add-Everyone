##Harvest-Add-Everyone

###What it Does
Adding people to Harvst projects is a pain, this is a Chrome extension which adds a bunch of buttons to the interface for adding different batches of people to a Harvest Project.

###How to Install
This assumes you have git set up on your machine, and have set up your Github credentials as well. If that all sounds foreign to you, instructions to do these things can be found here - [step 1](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#setting-up-git) (just Setting up Git) & [step 2](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) (that whole page)

- Open up a new Terminal window
- Type the following commands:
  - `cd ~/Desktop`
  - `git clone git@github.com:efatsi/Harvest-Add-Everyone.git`
    - This copies the project from Github on to your Desktop into a directory called `Harvest-Add-Everyone`.
- Visit `chrome://extensions` (in Chrome of course)
- Check the box next to **Developer Mode**
- Click **Load unpacked extensions**
- Find the `Harvest-Add-Everyone` directory on your Desktop and select it

You can then try to create or edit a Harvest project and see options to add Everyone or different Labs.
